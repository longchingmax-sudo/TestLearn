       <h2> How it all started</h2>
      <hr>
  It has all started when I saw these popular Roblox youtubers; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRkuUgtDAL4XSU5jB40J_wA"> Foltyn </a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KreekCraft"> KreekCraft </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Flush"> Flush </a>.
  Then on my birthday, 13th October 2025, I started my channel. Then I immediately record and uploaded my first video. Haven't do any editing. And one of my family member subscribe to me, yes, I got 1 subscriber that day. After that, just the next day I saw my video got 6 views which I'm super happy of. And about a week later, I reach 10 subscribers. I'm over exiting and immediately made a special video.
  And then I made my second Cabin Crew Simulator video and it came out great for some reason. It got like 50 veiws the next day I uploaded. and of course, about a week it hit 1K views. About a month later, it hit 5K! I was unable to control my self.
  Then I hit 50 subscribers, another special video! Then about  a month, 100 subscribers! And, another special video.
